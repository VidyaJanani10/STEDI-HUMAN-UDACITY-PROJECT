STEDI Human Balance Analytics Project

Project Overview

This project implements an end-to-end data lake and analytics pipeline using AWS S3, AWS Glue, and Amazon Athena to process sensor data from the STEDI Human Balance system.
The goal is to transform raw JSON sensor data into trusted, curated, and machine-learning–ready datasets using AWS Glue Visual ETL jobs, while validating each step through Athena queries.

This repository contains:
1.Folder-wise output screenshots
2.DDL generation evidence
3.Glue Visual ETL job execution proof
4.Athena query outputs
5.Python scripts extracted from Glue jobs for verification

Architecture Summary :
Data Storage: Amazon S3
Metadata Catalog: AWS Glue Data Catalog
ETL Processing: AWS Glue Studio (Visual ETL)
Query Engine: Amazon Athena
The pipeline follows the standard Landing → Trusted → Curated → Machine Learning flow.

Step 1: S3 Bucket Creation

A single S3 bucket was created with only three folders, as per project instructions:

customer/
accelerometer/
step_trainer/
All raw JSON files were uploaded into their respective folders.

Step 2: Glue Database Creation
A Glue database was created to store metadata for all landing, trusted, curated, and machine learning tables.

Step 3: Athena Configuration
Athena was configured as follows:
Navigated to Administration → Workgroups → Primary
Updated Query Result Configuration from Customer Managed to Athena Managed
Saved changes
Used Athena Query Console for all validations

Step 4: Landing Tables Creation in Athena
4.1 customer_landing

Source: customer/

Format: JSON
Columns:
customername (string)
email (string)
phone (string)
birthday (string)
serialnumber (string)
registrationdate (bigint)
lastupdatedate (bigint)
sharewithresearchasofdate (bigint)
sharewithpublicasofdate (bigint)
sharewithfriendsasofdate (bigint)

Validation Queries:

SELECT * FROM customer_landing;
SELECT count(*) FROM customer_landing;

Output: 956

4.2 accelerometer_landing

Source: accelerometer/
Format: JSON
Columns:
user (string)
timestamp (bigint)
x (float)
y (float)
z (float)
Output Count: 81,273

4.3 steptrainer_landing

Source: step_trainer/
Format: JSON
Columns:
sensorreadingtime (bigint)
serialnumber (string)
distancefromobject (int)
Output Count: 28,680

4.4 DDL Generation

DDL statements for all three landing tables were generated using:
Table menu → Run Query → Generate DDL
Screenshots are included in the repository.

Step 5: IAM Role Creation

An IAM role was created for Glue with:
Use case: Glue
Permissions:
AWSGlueServiceRole
AmazonS3FullAccess
CloudWatchFullAccess

Step 6: Glue Studio Visual ETL Jobs
6.1 Customer Landing → Trusted

Filtered records where shareWithResearchAsOfDate IS NOT NULL
Target: customer/trusted/
Output table: customer_trusted
Output Count: 482

6.2 Accelerometer Landing → Trusted

Joined accelerometer_landing.user with customer_trusted.email
Selected distinct accelerometer readings
Target: accelerometer/trusted/
Output Count: 40,981

6.3 Customer Trusted → Curated

Joined customer_trusted with accelerometer_trusted
Selected unique customer records
Target: customer/curated/
Output Count: 482

6.4 Step Trainer Landing → Trusted

Joined steptrainer_landing.serialnumber with customer_curated.serialnumber
Selected distinct step trainer readings
Target: steptrainer/trusted/
Output Count: 14,460

6.5 Machine Learning Curated

Joined accelerometer_trusted.timestamp with steptrainer_trusted.sensorreadingtime
Final dataset prepared for ML usage
Target: machinelearning_curated/
Output Count: 43,681

Screenshots of query execution and results are included for verification.
Python Script Backup
For audit and transparency:
Python scripts generated by Glue Visual ETL jobs were copied from the Script tab
Stored as text files inside the output folder
This ensures reproducibility and reviewer verification.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates a complete AWS-based analytics workflow using best practices for:
->Data organization
->ETL pipeline design
->Validation using Athena
->Clear documentation and evidence


All transformations strictly follow the project rubric and are validated with query results
